<h2>Bitcoin "Smart Contracts" (as Smart as Whatever's Reading Them)</h2>

<p>
Hivemind is a <b>Peer-to-Peer Oracle Protocol</b> which absorbs accurate data into a blockchain so that Bitcoin-users can speculate in <b>Prediction Markets</b>. These markets have many <a href="http://www.hivemind.com/papers/3_PM_Applications.pdf">applications</a> (which include superior alternatives to Lighthouse, Counterparty, Medici, Bitshares, and Ethereum) and have the potential to revolutionize the emergance and diffusion of knowledge in society.
</p>

If you've never even heard of Bitcoin before, try <a href="http://www.hivemind.com/presentations/what-is-truthcoin.pdf">What is Truthcoin?</a> (10 fun slides) to learn about what you've been missing this whole time. Those already familiar with Bitcoin 2.0 projects might enjoy <a href="https://github.com/truthcoin/www.hivemind.com/blob/gh-pages/faq/index.md#what-makes-truthcoin-different">What makes Truthcoin different?</a>

<h2>Bitcoin Maximal</h2>

<p>
Planned to be a <a href="http://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf">sidechain</a> of Bitcoin. This means that Bitcoin (and only Bitcoin) is used to create and trade in Markets. A separate coin-type does some pretty fancy things to ensure that a group of self-selected, anonymous, greedy users will always resolve the contract-outcomes honestly.

<h2>The Goal: Scientific Revolution Part II</h2>
<p>
Speaking technically, this project aims to get <b>external data into a blockchain</b> reliably, and use that data <b><u>efficiently</u></b> and <b><u>conservatively</u></b>.
</p>

<p>
However, unlike other blockchain-projects, the ultimate purpose is <b>NOT to establish a new payment system</b> (nor to delude the innocent with get-rich-quick nonsense), but instead to...

<ul>
  <li>...revolutionize <a href="http://www.hivemind.com/presentations/info-problems.pdf">the way information is created and spread</a>, giving the internet a "frontal lobe"...</li>
  <li>...overhaul <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html">democratic governance</a> (deemphasizing showmanship/PR, highlighting the irrelevance of race/gender/who-candidate-has-slept-with)...</li> 
  <li>...<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/04/rah-manic-monopolists.html">boost economic growth</a>...</li>
  <li>...provide <a href="http://www.hivemind.com/papers/3_PM_Applications.pdf">a novel way to efficiently fund public goods</a>, without taxation or coercion...</li>
  <li>...cut out all Wall St. / banking middlemen and replace them with <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/mktscore.pdf">tech</a>...</li>
  <li>...spearhead the campaign to make Bitcoin the world's internet currency...</li>
  <li>...and <a href="http://www.hivemind.com/papers/3_PM_Applications.pdf">more</a>!</li>
</ul>
