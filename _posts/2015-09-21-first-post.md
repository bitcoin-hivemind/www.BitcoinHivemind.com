title: Truthcoin Renamed as Hivemind

Hi everyone,

Created the Hivemind Webpage. It's basically the Truthcoin webpage (this emphasizes unity) with different sidebar colors (so that you don't get confused).

I will also be transitioning the forum, probably on Monday with a lot of other updates.

This blog area will be different: Hive-specific stuff, more casual, more frequently-updated. Posts will probably be of correspondingly lower quality ([so it goes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse-Five)).

Nonetheless, if you'd like to help with the play-money Testnet version of Hivemind, and you have C++ or Qt skills, please contact me!
