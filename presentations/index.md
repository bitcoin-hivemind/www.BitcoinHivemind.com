## [What is Truthcoin?](what-is-truthcoin.pdf)

What is this project, and what is it about?


## [Outcome Resolution](truthcoin-outcomes.pdf)

Everyone asks: How are the outcomes calculated? "Who decides?" Here are some of the answers.

## [The Age of Bullshit](info-problems.pdf)

The real-world problem Truthcoin aims to solve. This was the first half of a talk I gave at the MIT Bitcoin club in January 2015.

Update: a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzaVt7uN4p4) of an [even better presentation](hm-why.pdf) at TAB Conf Jan 2018.

## [The Oracle Problem](https://www.slideshare.net/InfoQ/blockchain-the-oracle-problems)

Slides from [my March 2017 talk at QCon](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/blockchain-oracle-problems). Covers the technical challenges of this project (and why other methods haven't worked).


## [Value of a VoteCoin](hivemind-valuable.pdf)

On the potential Return available to contributing investors / programmers.

<!--


This presentation is confusing way more people than it is helping.

## [Initial Coin Allocations](initial-coin-allocations.pdf)

Who is getting the first Truthcoins? Hint: probably, you!

## [In Six Slides](six-slide-sprint.pdf)

The original [BoostVC formatted](https://medium.com/boost-vc/5-rules-for-the-pitch-deck-d7c7bbc3185d) 6 slide pitch deck...this  presentation relied (dangerously) on a lot of in-person context ("humor"), which is probably lost on the random internet viewer. (Truthcoin did get funding, however).
